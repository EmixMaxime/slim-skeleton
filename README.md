# About Slim Framework 3 Skeleton Application
Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 3 application.

It uses :
- The latest Slim 3.
- The Twig template renderer.
- Monolog logger

It provides a way to bundle your assets using webpack. It's based on my [front end boilerplace](https://github.com/EmixMaxime/Front-end-boilerplate) (big thank's to [Grafikart](https://github.com/Grafikart/Front-end-boilerplate))

It's inspired by [Slim-Skeleton](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton) built by Slim team.
The purpose it's to be more power full and complete.
